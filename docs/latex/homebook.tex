% If you want to compile your document you have TWO ways
% depending on the fact that 
% 	1) you have inserted only postcript images in your tex file 
%		---> then go to MODE 1
%	2) you have inserted other kind of images (jpg..) in your tec file
%		---> then go to MODE 2
%
% MODE 1 
%simple type:
% 	latex homebook.tex
%
% If the compilation runs succesfully and you want to see the results type:
% 	xdvi homebook.dvi &
% and use the menus to go through the document
%
% If you want to create a pdf type:
% 	dvipdfm homebook.dvi
%
% a homebook.pdf file is created
% you can see it using the command:
% 	acroread homebook.pdf &
%
%
% MODE 2
% simple type:
%	pdflatex homebook.tex
%
% If the compilation runs succesfully you directly have the pdf file
% and you can see it using the command:
%       acroread homebook.pdf &

\newpage
\chapter[Summary]{Summary}
This report contains the functionality and details of the implementation of a 5-stage-pipelined
DLX processor presented as our final project for the course Microelectronics System.

This implementation contains many features which include:
\begin{itemize}
	\item A modified Booth's algorithm-based multiplicaton unit for supporting signed and unsigned multiplication.
	\item A modified Non-Restoring algorithm-based division unit for supporting signed and unsigned division.
	\item Square Root operation support performed by the modified division unit.
	\item Branch prediction feature based on 2-bit saturating counter.
	\item Hazard handling by forwarding techniques.
\end{itemize}

The synthesis result shows that the final critical path delay of our processor is sufficient
to $T_{ck}=2.5$. The calculated area after optimizing the delay of critical path was around 31421.
